Play tic-tac-toe in your browser by downloading the HTML and JavaScript files.

Play tic-tac-toe with a friend. Players take turns putting down X's or O's, with the goal of getting three in a row along a row, column, or diagonal.
Once a game has concluded, there is the option to replay. The program keeps track of the total number of games won for each player.
